## Question
### General question (Yes / No)
We use ***asked*** and ***if / whether*** and do not change the word order (subject + verb):
- "Do you enjoy doing talk shows?" (I **asked** him **if / whether** he enjoyed doing talk shows);
### Special question (What / Where / When / How)
We just use ***what / where / when / how*** :
- "So what does it mean?" (He asked me what that meant.)

## Backshift changes (the main rule — *one step back*)

- "Tokyo is a capital of China". (He said Tokyo is a capital of China.) 
- "I'm in the hospital now". (She said he is in the hospital now);

## Say / tell
- He **told** + me / us / him / her ... that... (без лица не употребляем)
- He **said** that... ; he said **to** + me / us / him / her ... that...
